            <h2>Site description</h2>
            <p>Its a site i made in html using css for styling and vanilla JavaScript for other functions such as
                animations, popups etc. It's based on an app i have build but the main purpose of this site is to
                showcase my web dev skills. I made a replica of this site on wordpress as well. No library was used and
                all the functions are made in scratch.

                To demonstrate that its truly made by me, I can provide its source code. It is my first personal project
                to showcase but i am not new to development as i have worked on sites before, albeit most of the time it
                included just fixing bugs and making the site responsive for every size.

                The main thing i focused on it, are the animations. Mainly transitions that happens when the user is on
                a specific section. I have provided a video below to show how the animations work on both the
                mobile and desktop.</p>

            <h2>App description</h2>
            <p>It is in react native expo in which users can add recipes, update, delete them. After making it work
                offline, I add online features in it such as signup/signin, online database. Users are able to store
                their recipes online bounded with their account.Registering or logging in automatically uploads all the
                offline recipes into online database.
                I added another feature of storing recipes offline until user connects to internet. This happens only if
                the user is logged into an account.
                I connected database with expressJS.
                The other featues includes a shopping cart where users can enter items with their prices. There is also
                a food randomizer where all the recipes are shuffled and one is shown. You may remove/add any recipe
                from the randomizer.
                I also added the ability to share recipes and add them into favourites.
                I used mongodb for database. The whole took me about a month or two as i was learning react native and
                backend along building it.

                    <p>It took me about a month or two. In hours, its likely less than 30. For the site, it took me
                        about 5-7 hours. That includes getting assets for it.</p>
